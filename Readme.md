# Dear Reviewer

**THANK YOU**! ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíú

I need and appreciate your open, honest feedback. With your help this book will be better.

The review deadline is Nov 24, 2023. Please send me feedback in any form: email, text, PRs... whatever is most convenient. Every bit of your feedback helps, even a single sentence. I've got a thick skin so just let me have it as if you're reviewing a book from a complete stranger.

I made a list of issues below to capture stuff I'm already aware of and working on. As for what kinds of feedback I'm seeing, please see [Feedback ideas](#feedback-ideas), below.

I'd like to wait to release everything publicly once it is ready, so please help me keep it secret for now.

## Directory structure

| path     | description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `build/` | build outputs appear here             |
| `src/`   | sources for the book                  |
| `mario/` | sources for _mario_ provisioning tool |

## Book formats

I use Pandoc to produce multiple typeset versions of the book from a single source file: `src/book.md`. Formatted outputs are available at FIXME.

It generates an EPUB, a HTML file, and printable and screen-friendly PDFs.

If you want to generate your own typeset outputs, run `./typeset.sh`. See "Prerequisites to build the book" in `src/book.md`.

## Feedback ideas

Here's what I'm looking for:

* What are your first impressions? Cover, table of contents, font, style, page size, book length, etc.
* Any/all factual, spelling, grammatical, and structural errors.
* Inscrutable thrust of a section. Does it make sense what I'm trying to convey and how?
* Inconsistencies in voice, level of detail, narrative flow.
* Anywhere a diagram or photo would significantly help to illustrate a point.
* Any sections that should be rewritten, rethought, or removed.
* Is there a relevant and useful technology that isn't mentioned and should be?
* Test out _mario_ on your own hardware/VM. Does it work for you as advertised?
* Is this something you'd actually read?
* Is this something you'd recommend to others?
* What would you expect to pay for a print copy?
* What would you expect to pay for a digital copy?

## Issues

Here's a quick summary of the stuff I'm aware of and working on. IDs start with `am` to avoid conflicts with IDs that might be generated by some other issue tracker, should I choose one. I (Adam) am the assignee for all of these.
