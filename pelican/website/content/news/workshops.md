I'll be running hands-on workshops where readers and fans can come together to help each other get unblocked wherever we're at, from thinking about self-hosting to improving smooth-running servers and services.
The workshops will focus on fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques from the book, although having and having read the book is not required.
