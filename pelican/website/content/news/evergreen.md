Ebook readers rejoice: we just got several recent typesetting improvements thanks to [Georger](https://github.com/georgeraraujo) including centering captions and conforming the table of contents across formats.

I am grateful for Georger's patches.
This is exactly why I used FOSS licensing.
The book is an evergreen work, ever growing and evolving.

In other news:

* We're working on a German translation ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. ETA September.
* I made a conscious effort to use zero exclamation marks in this post but believe me, I am _stoked_.
