Thank you for getting my book.
Please leave me a review.
Good reviews will attract more potential readers.
They'll really make a difference.
If you have negative feedback, I want that too!
Maybe just [send it directly to me first]({filename}/pages/contact.md).
Give me a chance to earn your five-star review.
My goal is to earn 10 reviews on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Steadfast-Self-Hosting-Rapid-Rise-Personal-Cloud/dp/B0D7NLJHM5/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215055801-steadfast-self-hosting), [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/shop/adam-monsen-and-lenny-wondra/steadfast-self-hosting/paperback/product-w4z5ewj.html), and [Gumroad](https://meonkeys.gumroad.com/l/shb) by the end of the week.
I'd appreciate your help if you have the time.
Thank you.
Together we can help spread the word about self-hosting!

Heart,<br/>
-Adam

Looks like the book is on its way to the [Seattle Public Library](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S30C3996752), too!
