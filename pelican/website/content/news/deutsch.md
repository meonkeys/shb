The German translation is available for purchase in [ebook](https://meonkeys.gumroad.com/l/shb-de) and [paperback](https://www.lulu.com/shop/adam-monsen-and-fiona-burkart/zuverlässiges-self-hosting/paperback/product-jej7qjn.html).
Happy new year!

The $10 ebook bundle price includes beautifully formatted EPUB, A4 PDF, and HTML versions of the book.
The English version now uses the same pricing.
If you want the ebook and cannot afford it, [contact me]({filename}/pages/contact.md) for a discount code.

The $25 paperback is a 6" x 9" (US Trade) paperback full-color print with durable matte cover, available direct from the printer now, and eventually available most places you can buy books (it takes a while for Lulu's "global distribution" to kick in).
