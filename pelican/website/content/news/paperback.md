### Quality

I currently use Lulu [print on demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_on_demand).

I took my time experimenting with Lulu.
They offer many choice combinations as far as materials and quality.
I formatted and tested a few and landed on two versions: A "standard" economical and good-looking print, as well as a "premium" print with better ink and less print variance.

Here are some photos of actual prints.
I saw most obvious differences in the color photos and illustrations.
The content changed a bit between prints, so ignore differences like "Figure 7" vs. "Figure 8".
Ignore object distortion, too; that's me trying to line up the shots by hand.

These photos capture how the premium ink shines a bit in direct light.
I like the effect, but YMMV.

I can't comment on variance between prints/printers, that's up to Lulu.
Please see the [Lulu printing quality FAQ](https://help.lulu.com/en/support/solutions/articles/64000255474-printing-the-basics).

[Offset printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_printing) looks cool too but I'm not ready for that level of scale and commitment.
