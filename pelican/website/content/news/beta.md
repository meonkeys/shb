### Early access to *Steadfast Self-Hosting*

<mark>The beta is now full and closed.
Thank you for your interest!
Original invite text preserved for posterity, below.</mark>

You're invited!
Be a part of a select group of individuals with the power to make a *great* book *excellent*.
This is a unique opportunity to influence the direction of the book prior to printing, publication, and general availability.
I'm calling this my "beta".
As a beta reader you'll get:

* early access to EPUB, HTML, and PDF versions of the book
* all source code and access to source control
* access to chat and email with the beta group and one-on-one with the author
* deep gratitude from the author

Beta readers are expected to:

* read the book
* read the source
* run the source
* provide feedback on all of the above
* join the chat and mailing list

You may seek an exception to these expectations; just ask.

Please [contact me]({filename}/pages/contact.md) and let me know you want to be a beta reader.

### How it works

Yep, I really want you to read my book for free!
I'm doing this to perfect the pre-print book and raise awareness about it.

Joining the beta is free (gratis) and anyone may ask to join.

All members of the beta must follow our [rules]({filename}/pages/rules.md).

The beta book is available in US English only.
