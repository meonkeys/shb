### Early access to *Steadfast Self-Hosting*

You're invited! Be a part of a select group of individuals with the power to make a *great* book *excellent*.
This is a unique opportunity to influence the direction of the book prior to printing, publication, and general availability.
I'm calling this my "beta".
As a beta reader you'll get:

* early access to EPUB, HTML, and PDF versions of the book
* all source code and access to source control
* access to chat and email with the beta group and one-on-one with the author
* deep gratitude from the author

Beta readers are expected to:

* read the book
* read the source
* run the source
* provide feedback on all of the above
* join the chat and mailing list

You may seek an exception to these expectations; just ask.

Please [contact me]({filename}/pages/contact.md) and let me know you want to be a beta reader.

### How it works

Yep, I really want you to read my book for free!
I'm doing this to perfect the pre-print book and raise awareness about it.

Joining the beta is free (gratis) and anyone may ask to join.

The beta book is offered under familiar, terribly restrictive, and proprietary terms suitably only for evaluation copies: *All rights reserved*.
This is so we can perfect the book in a walled garden before it is distributed widely and openly.
The final published book and corresponding source code will use licensing that promotes sharing and freedom (e.g. copyleft, creative commons).

All members of the beta must follow our [rules]({filename}/pages/rules.md).

The beta book is available in US English only.
