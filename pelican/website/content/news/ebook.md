The book is done and I'm excited to set it loose!

I wanted to share paper copies first but printing this baby is challenging.
It's probably me: I want it to look great, I'm self-publishing, and I'm doing all this for the first time.
So yeah, it's taking a while longer than I expected.
Shouldn't be much longer now though, probably about a month.

While I'm working on printing, I published digital copies.
[Please buy one today]({filename}/pages/buy.md).
I don't want money to be a barrier here; if you can't afford to buy it you can get it for free.

### Great job!

Thank you!

### How much is it? Where do I get it?

See [ðŸ’µ Buy]({filename}/pages/buy.md).

### I found a bug / typo

You rock.
Will you please [let me know about it]({filename}/pages/contact.md) and/or [send me a patch]({filename}/pages/code.md)?

### I added ten services to mario

You rock.
Will you share what you did [here](https://help.selfhostbook.com/t/extensions)?

### Why can't I get the book on my bookseller/platform/device?

Because I have issues.
It's lot of work, some promote [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management), they track you, it costs money, stuff like that.

### When can I get one printed on actual paper?

Soon!
Probably in a month or so.

### Where's the party?

We should do one!
I was kinda waiting for printed copies to be ready; those would be really handy for in-person gatherings.

### Yay, AGPL / ugh, AGPL

Yep, I hear you!

### I bought the book, it is rad, what next?

Buy one to share with a friend.
Talk to your local school or public librarian to request a copy or buy one for them.

### I don't like the book

Dang!
I tried my best.
Please [let me know]({filename}/pages/contact.md) why you didn't like it.
Consider [sharing your thoughts publicly](https://help.selfhostbook.com/t/reviews).
You can also [improve it or write a better one]({filename}/pages/code.md).

### I can translate this, and I want to!

Great!
See [ðŸ’» Code]({filename}/pages/code.md).

### Wait, it is FOSS, I can pay for it *and* it is free? Why are you leaving money on the table? How can you afford to do this?

Those are excellent questions.
Briefly:

1. Yes it is FOSS and you can pay what you're able & willing to to buy it, hopefully I'm not leaving money on the table
1. if I am leaving money on the table it's because I'm prioritizing distribution over profit, and
1. I kinda can't afford to do this. ðŸ˜† But it sure is fun!

The detailed explanation is, well, detailed.
If you're interested I could explain it over coffee or on a podcast or something.
