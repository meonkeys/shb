The book is done and I'm excited to set it loose!

I wanted to share paper copies first, and printing this baby is challenging.
It's probably me: I want it to look great, I'm self-publishing, and I'm doing all this for the first time.
So yeah, it's taking a while longer than I expected.

While I'm working on printing, I published digital copies.
[Please buy one today]({filename}/pages/buy.md).
I don't want money to be a barrier here; if you can't afford to buy it you can get it for free.

### Great job!

Thank you!

### How much is it? Where do I get it?

See [ðŸ’µ Buy]({filename}/pages/buy.md).

### I found a bug

You rock.
Will you please [let me know about it]({filename}/pages/contact.md) and/or [send me a patch]({filename}/pages/code.md)?

### I added ten services to mario

You rock.
Will you share what you did [here](https://help.selfhostbook.com/t/extensions)?

### Why can't I get the book on (insert your favorite distributor/device)?

Because I have issues.
It's lot of work to use these platforms, some promote [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management), they track you, it costs money, stuff like that.

### When can I get one printed on actual paper?

Soon!
Probably in a month or so.

### Where's the party?

We should do one!
I was kinda waiting for printed copies to be ready; those would be really handy for in-person gatherings.

### Yay, AGPL, or ugh, AGPL

Yep, I hear you!

### I like the book and I bought one, what next?

Buy one to share with a friend.
Talk to your local school or public librarian to request a copy or buy one for them.

### I don't like the book

Dang!
I tried my best.
