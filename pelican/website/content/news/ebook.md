The book is done and I'm excited to set it loose!

I wanted to share paper copies first but printing this baby is challenging.
It's probably me: I want it to look great, I'm self-publishing, and I'm doing all this for the first time.
So yeah, it's taking a while longer than I expected.
Shouldn't be much longer now though, probably about a month.

While I'm working on printing, I published digital copies.
[Please buy one today]({filename}/pages/buy.md).
I don't want money to be a barrier here; if you can't afford to buy it you can get it for free.
