🚀 Got a new service of your own to share? [I shared a Pi-hole extension to mario](https://help.selfhostbook.com/t/ext) and I intend to share more.

🐞 Found a bug? [Send me a patch]({filename}/pages/code.md). Be a part of [possibly the first] self-hosting [book's commit] history! I've done a few releases already, and I'll incorporate all the latest fixes and improvements in the next release.

💞 Loved the book? Please give me a positive rating/review wherever you buy books (not necessarily where you got it). I need your help spreading the word!

🖋️ Want me to sign your book? I'd love to. Come to a workshop, like the one this weekend at FOSSY.

📖 [Paperbacks are available direct from the printer](https://selfhostbook.com/buy/). You can buy a copy from many other booksellers as well or request it at your local library.
