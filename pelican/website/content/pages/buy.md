Please buy a copy of my book if you can afford to.
I worked hard on every part of this book, it's excellent, and book sales help me continue this work!

No worries if you are unwilling or unable to pay: Free and discounted copies are available.
I chose this flexible pricing structure to prioritize distribution over profit.

### Ebook bundle

This includes beautifully formatted EPUB, A4 PDF, and HTML versions.
Now available on Gumroad:

The Supporter price is automatically adjusted with [purchasing power parity](https://help.gumroad.com/article/327-purchasing-power-parity){:target="_blank"}.

### Paperback

The excellent, size A6, US Trade paperback full-color print with durable matte cover.
160 pages of delicious paper and ink (warning: do not eat).
Perfect for your offline reading pleasure.

[Standard: USD 25.00](https://www.lulu.com/shop/adam-monsen-and-lenny-wondra/steadfast-self-hosting/paperback/product-w4z5ewj.html){:target="_blank"}

If you're not sure which one to get, go standard.
If you want the best there is, go premium.
The premium version promises better ink for [higher contrast and deeper saturation]({filename}/news/paperback.md), and less variance between prints/printers.

### Hardcover

I don't have plans to print a hardcover edition.

### Other book versions

There are many other ways to read the book.
See [this chart](https://github.com/meonkeys/shb#%EF%B8%8F-book-formats) for details about each version and [discuss them](https://help.selfhostbook.com/t/read) if you like.

### Donations

If you'd like to send money directly to support me, thank you, that's awesome.
It's helpful if you also [send me an email]({filename}/pages/contact.md) so I have some context.
Include **Gift** in the email subject.
Tell me how much you're sending and why.
If the "why" is "to pay for the book", please buy the book from Gumroad instead (for tax reasons -- my publisher must deal with taxes when selling the book and Gumroad handles this).
If you're sending cryptocurrency, please tell me the equivalent USD amount (this is really helpful for my taxes if/when I decide to convert it to fiat money).

I've listed these in order of preference.
Peercoin is especially interesting to me.
I wish I could put it at the top, but it's too volatile and difficult to exchange for the flavor of fiat money I use to buy groceries.

I sincerely appreciate these gifts.
I'm not a charity so these donations are not tax-deductible.

### Hire me

Somewhat related: I'm looking for work!
I'd like to write another book but I can't afford to right now.
I'll either need this book to sell well, get an advance for my next book, or take on other work.
If I take on other work, ideally I'd be able to do work related to the book like speaking engagements, training, FOSS homelab/homeprod install/support/maintenance, FOSS desktop computing, home personal cloud appliances, nonprofit sustainable tech, or maybe running a community data center.

If you have an another/unrelated job idea please [let me know]({filename}/pages/contact.md).
I'm able to do a lot of things well.
