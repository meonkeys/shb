### Other book versions

There are many other ways to read the book.

### Donations

If you'd like to send money directly to support me, thank you, that's awesome.
It's helpful if you also [send me an email]({filename}/pages/contact.md) so I have some context.
Include **Gift** in the email subject.
Tell me how much you're sending and why.
If the "why" is "to pay for the book", please instead buy an ebook or paperback using the links above (this helps my publisher deal with taxes).
If you're sending cryptocurrency, please tell me the equivalent USD amount (this is really helpful for my taxes if/when I decide to convert it to fiat money).

Here are ways to send me donations, in order of preference.
Peercoin is especially interesting to me.
I wish I could put it at the top, but it's too volatile and difficult to exchange for the flavor of fiat money I use to buy groceries.

| method   | address                            |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| Zelle    | haircut@gmail.com                  |
| PayPal   | haircut@gmail.com                  |
| Venmo    | haircut@gmail.com or @meonkeys     |
| Bitcoin  | 18XjpBwNccX9cvC2qiUgXLeeyY1jj3g5QW |
| Peercoin | PHmoZs42PK4gn4nnsZRjiTtaDtgtxhHTQb |

I sincerely appreciate these gifts.
I'm not a charity so these donations are not tax-deductible.

### Hire me

Somewhat related: I'm looking for work!
I'd like to write another book but I can't afford to right now.
I'll either need this book to sell well, get an advance for my next book, or take on other work.
If I take on other work, ideally I'd be able to do work related to the book like speaking engagements, training, FOSS homelab/homeprod install/support/maintenance, FOSS desktop computing, home personal cloud appliances, nonprofit sustainable tech, or maybe running a community data center.

If you have an another/unrelated job idea please [let me know]({filename}/pages/contact.md).
I'm able to do a lot of things well.
