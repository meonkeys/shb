### Origin story

I researched and wrote the book over several years.
I've been working on related technologies professionally and personally for the last couple of decades.

I wrote this book after having realized the power and potential of self-hosting.
I used the method it describes to provide a robust data haven for myself and my family.
I haven't found other books like it and I want mine to be the first.

I've given lectures on self-hosting and received feedback from attendees: they are already experienced at learning tech, they are seeking the motivation to self-host along with high-quality information on how to do it well.
In response to this feedback I wrote a large Background chapter.
In it, I approach self-hosting with a good deal of justification for why someone should self-host at all.
I use anecdotes, figures, and tenants of relatable value-based living to provide sufficient motivation for getting through the learning and implementation stages of self-hosting.

### Audience

*Steadfast* primarily targets aspiring self-hosters looking for a quick and reliable method to get started.
Some basic IT and networking skills are required.
A reader should be familiar with Linux, command-line basics, and transferring files to and from a server.

Experienced self-hosters will also benefit when they read, compare, and improve their existing homelabs.
