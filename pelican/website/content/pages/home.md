### From the back cover

Perils await, dear hero: the self-hosting ecosystem is crowded and confusing.

Fear not! Iâ€™ll help you quickly set up useful services on your very own server.

This book is your personal guide to joy; a battle-tested fast path to success. Learn how to quickly stand up reliable **services** in **containers** behind a **reverse proxy**.

With these three basic components we will summon a robust data haven. We'll take some basic concepts from systems administration and devops to create love, beauty, and deep meaning.

### Tools in the book

The book details why and how to use these tools to self-host:

* bare metal physical server
* Ubuntu operating system
* Ansible provisioner
* Traefik reverse proxy
* Docker container manager

It cover specific services you should host, mostly Nextcloud.

### Origin story

I researched and wrote the book for several years.
I've been working on related technologies professionally and personally for the last couple of decades.

I wrote this book after having realized the power and potential of self-hosting.
I used the method it describes to provide a robust data haven for myself and my family.
I haven't found other books like it and I want mine to be the first.

I've given lectures on self-hosting and received feedback from attendees: they are already experienced at learning tech, they are seeking the motivation to self-host along with high-quality information on how to do it well.
In response to this feedback I wrote a large Background chapter.
In it, I approach self-hosting with a good deal of justification for why someone should self-host at all.
I use anecdotes, figures, and tenants of relatable value-based living to provide sufficient motivation for getting through the learning and implementation stages of self-hosting.

### Audience

*Steadfast* primarily targets beginning self-hosters looking for a quick and reliable method to get started. Some basic IT and networking skills are required. A reader should be familiar with Linux, command-line basics, and transferring files to and from a server.

Experienced self-hosters will also benefit when they read, compare, and improve their existing homelabs.
