### Install mario

mario is a free tool I built to help you set up and maintain a server as you read the book.
See `mario/Readme.md` in the source code.

### Translate

I would love to make this book available in lanauges besides English.
Please [contact me]({filename}/pages/contact.md) about translating the book.

The entire book is contained in `steadfast.asciidoc`, a plain text file in [AsciiDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc) markup.
You'll need to know [basic AsciiDoc syntax](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/).
I can help with the code changes necessary to build the translated book.

I want translators to be paid for their work.
I think it'd be awesome if you translate and distribute the book, and we share the proceeds 50/50.
