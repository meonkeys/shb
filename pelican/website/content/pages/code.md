## Source code

The source code is available to members of the [beta]({filename}/news/beta.md).

## Install mario

See `mario/Readme.md` in the source code.

## Translate

[Contact me]({filename}/pages/contact.md) about translating the book.
The entire book is contained in `steadfast.asciidoc`, a plain text file in [Asciidoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc) markup.
I can help with the code, config, and deploy changes necessary to accommodate the translation.
I'm thinking we might want translations in forked repositories, and it might also be nice to have them all in one place.
I haven't decided yet.
