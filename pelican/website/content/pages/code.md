### Install mario

mario is a free tool I built to help you set up and maintain a server as you read the book.
See `mario/Readme.md` in the source code.

### Translate

I would love to make this book available in lanauges besides English.
Please [contact me]({filename}/pages/contact.md) about translating the book.

The entire book is contained in `steadfast.asciidoc`, a plain text file in [Asciidoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc) markup.
I can help with the code, config, and deploy changes necessary to accommodate the translation.
I'm thinking we might want translations in forked repositories, and it might also be nice to have them all in one place... I'm not sure.
Suggestions welcome (especially if you've done this before).

I want translators to be paid for their work.
I think it'd be awesome if you translate and distribute the book, and we share the proceeds 50/50.
Let me know your thoughts.
