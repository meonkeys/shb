* pay attention to and follow the existing style
** standardize whenever possible and formalize conventions here
* images
** center most and constrain to 80% wide
* exclude optional slashes at ends of hyperlinks
* capitalize product/project names in prose as they appear in upstream's branding/docs
* capitalize only the first letter of the first word of sections/headers
** except: follow styling of proper nouns, acronyms, etc.
* lists
** ordered lists
*** use captals and periods, even if using incomplete sentences
* define jargon and acronym twice:
** at first appearance, immediately following the term, in parentheses or locale-appropriate delimiters
** in the glossary
* footnotes
** don't use footnotes
* links
** include links next to or very near context, but try to avoid breaking the flow of text
** always include typed-out URL, never link text directly
*** this is to ensure consistent appearance across print and electronic versions
** exclude URL scheme from http(s) links
*** this is handled automatically by asciidoc option `hide-uri-scheme`
*** `https` is a safe guess/default (and hopefully people insist on `https` client-side!)
** if a link works without `www.` at the beginning of the domain name, omit it
*** this is bit of a risk: we're prioritizing shorter links in favor of more reliable links (some websites redirect, adding back `www.`)
** if a link works without a SEO slug, omit it
*** example w/slug: `+https://reddit.com/r/BorgBackup/comments/v3bwfg/why_should_i_switch_from_restic_to_borg/+`
*** example w/o slug: `+https://reddit.com/r/BorgBackup/comments/v3bwfg/+`
*** shorter is better, canonical/permalink is best (if you are forced to choose)
** use more readable version for cross references whenever possible
*** no: `+<<_more_about_foss>>+`
*** yes: `+<<More about FOSS>>+`
* use "`command line`" to refer to a Linux text-based interactive user interface
* use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma[Oxford commas]
* use https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line[one sentence] https://sive.rs/1s[per line]
* shell scripts
** prefer long form for command line flags, e.g. `--attribute` instead of `-a`
** prioritize portability and maintainability
* release versioning
** use semver-like major, minor, patch version numbers
* source control
** commit early and often
** group logically related changes into single commits
*** consider future maintainers may wish to `git revert`: try to make that easy for them
** group a series of related changes in a branch
** squashing is OK
** before submitting patches:
*** ensure build passes
** commit log messages
*** the first line of a commit log message is very important: say precisely *what* change you made, save the *why* for the rest
*** use infinitive verb forms, e.g. "`add -q quiet option`"
*** don't wrap body text

** ChangeLog
*** one entry per release
*** summarize major changes since last release
*** use infinitve forms for "`xyz happened`" statements
* use `shb` namespace for document attributes
** short for "`self-hosting book`"
** example: `shb-printPDF`, used when generating a PDF for printing
* include a trailing slash when referencing folders, e.g. `ansible/`
* indexing
** prefer https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/sections/user-index/#index-terms[flow index terms over concealed index terms]
** use your gut: index a term when it feels helpful to draw the reader's attention somewhere to read more about the term
** don't worry about indexing every occurence of a particular term -- focus on where it is specifically discussed/defined, rather than just used
** note: indexes are only generated for PDF outputs
* data is plural, use context for singular (e.g. "`piece of data`")
* colons: captalize word after? sometimes? *TBD*
* em dash: omit space before and after
