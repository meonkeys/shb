	v5 - reviewers only

	* Add final image (squeaky-clean-chicken.png). Still accepting edits.

	v3 - reviewers only

	* This includes quite a few updates. I expanded the style guide and
	conformed links and other aspects of look & feel. I just need to digest
	any last review feedback and prepare for printing.

	* I've expanded the review window a bit. If you haven't had a chance to
	review and still want to, go for it! Anything helps.
