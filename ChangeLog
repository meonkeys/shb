	v5 - reviewers only

	* Added final image (squeaky-clean-chicken.png). Still accepting edits.

	* I'm working on a print ready PDF. I want a smaller-size A5 book rather
	than the larger default A4 size.

	* Last version for review, maybe! All the inline FIXMEs and TODOs are

	v3 - reviewers only

	* This includes quite a few updates. I expanded the style guide and
	conformed links and other aspects of look & feel. I just need to digest
	any last review feedback and prepare for printing.

	* I've expanded the review window a bit. If you haven't had a chance to
	review and still want to, go for it! Anything helps.
