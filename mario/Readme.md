## Fix for `six.moves` module error on 22.04

If your admin computer is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS you may see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ansible.module_utils.six.moves'`. The root cause may be [this issue](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81946). If so, the fix is to add the [ansible PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ansible/+archive/ubuntu/ansible) and install the `ansible-core` package.

## Fix for missing `ufw` on 22.04

If your admin computer is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and you get an error that the `ufw` module is missing, make sure the `ansible` package is installed.

## Fix for US/Pacific timezone error
