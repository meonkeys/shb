The index is a section in the back of the book with references to select notable occurrences of terms and their page numbers.
Asciidoctor https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/sections/user-index/[only generates an index for PDF output].
I think that's OK since the other book formats are searchable.

The print PDF excludes _Cross references_ because page numbers are not rendered, reducing the usefulness of this chapter in print. See am64 in `issues.adoc`.
